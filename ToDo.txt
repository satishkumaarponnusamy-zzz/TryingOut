Find whether a string is palindrome or not, given a freedom (number of characters that doesn't need to match)
There was brute force algo to find the first repitition of a byte data, find optimal solution, used hash set
Tree with usual properties and each node points to the node on the right (if no right node then it is null) Given a tree with missing links fill them (optimize to use constant storage)
Convert a string to palindrome with minimum number of appends at end of the string, give O(N) solution
